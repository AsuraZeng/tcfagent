 This module implements BASE64 encoding and decoding of binary data.
 BASE64 encoding is adapted from RFC 1421, with one change:
 BASE64 eliminates the "*" mechanism for embedded clear text.
 Also TCF version of the encoding does not allow characters outside of the BASE64 alphabet.

 Event queue manager.
 Event is a data pointer plus a function pointer (a.k.a. event handler).
 .
 Posting event means placing event into event queue.
 Dispatching event means removing event from the queue and then calling
 event function with event data as argument.
 .
 All events are dispatched by single thread - dispatch thread. This makes it safe
 to access global data structures from event handlers without further synchronization,
 while allows for high level of concurrency.

 TCF Streams - generic service to support streaming of data between host and remote agents.
 .
 The service supports:
 1. Asynchronous overlapped data streaming: multiple 'read' or 'write' command can be issued at same time, both peers
 can continue data processing concurrently with data transmission.
 2. Multicast: multiple clients can receive data from same stream.
 3. Subscription model: clients are required to expressed interest in particular streams by subscribing for the service.
 4. Flow control: peers can throttle data flow of individual streams by delaying 'read' and 'write' commands.

 Hook definition for LWS callback.  This hook can be used to plug your own
 code in the various libwebsockets hooks. For more information about the possible
 value for those hooks refer to libwebsockets documentation. The return
 value is either ignored or a value different from 0 indicates an error.
 The arguments are exactly the same as for libwebsockets hook except for the first
 one which provides a pointer to a location where you can store callback specific data.

 This module implements a query based system to specify subsets of contexts.
 The queries specifies context properties and what values they need to have to match.
 In addition a query can filter based on a contexts ancestors in the context hierarchy.

 Abstract asynchronous data cache support.
 .
 In TCF, asynchronous caches are used to implement software design,
 which we call ACPM (Asynchronous Cache Programming Model).
 ACPM is formalized Programming Pattern for guaranteed data consistency
 when dealing with multiple remote data sources.
 .
 Usage example.
 This example assumes that Context represents execution context on remote target,
 and context data is kept in a cache that is updated on demand by sending asynchronous
 data requests to a remote peer.
 .
 The example shows how to implement cache client, in this case TCF command handle,
 that handle cache misses by waiting until the cache is updated and the re-executing
 cache client code.

 Implements UDP based service discovery.
 .
 The discovery protocol uses unicast and multicast UDP packets to propagate information
 about available TCF peers. The protocol is truly distributed - all participants have
 same functionality and no central authority is defined.
 .
 TCF discovery scope is one subnet. Access across subnets is supported by TCF proxy.
 .
 TCF discovery participants use a dedicated UDP port - 1534, however discovery will
 work fine if the port is not available for some participants, but at least one
 participant on a subnet must be able to bind itself to the default port, otherwise the protocol
 will not function properly. An agent that owns a default port is called "master",
 an agent that owns non-default port is called "slave".
 .
 Every slave will check periodically availability of default port, and can become a master if
 the port becomes available.
 .
 Since slaves cannot receive multicast packets, each agent maintains a list of slaves,
 and uses unicast packets to sent info to agents from the list.

 Target service implementation: run control (TCF name RunControl)
 .
 All run control contexts are grouped by corresponding memory address spaces.
 Other service implementations can ask run control to execute arbitrary code while all contexts in
 a particular group - address space - are stopped.
 Run control service manages a queue of such requests ("safe events queue") and
 makes a fair effort to optimize such requests. It can, for example, coalesce
 multiple requests for same address space, which often significantly improves performance.
 "Safe event" code is guaranteed to run while relevant contexts are stopped and will not be resumed
 during the event execution, with a single exception of single instruction step support
 that would resume only the specified context.
 .
 Run control service distinguishes between context being stopped and being intercepted.
 A context is stopped when it is suspended for any reason - breakpoint, safe event, a suspend request, etc..
 A context is intercepted when it is reported up (to UI or value-add) as suspended.
 .
 For example, a breakpoint hit handling sequence looks like this:
